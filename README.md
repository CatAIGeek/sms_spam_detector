# sms_spam_detector

Challenge 21

In this challenge, I was tasked to refactor code from an SMS text classification solution into a function that constructs a linear Support Vector Classification (SVC) model. Once the model was created and trained, I had to create a Gradio app to host the application, enabling users to test text messages. The application provides feedback to users, indicating whether the text is classified as spam or not, based on the model's performance.  

This challange was a little tricky for me at first due to a mixup I had in mistakenly moving my blocks of code out of order. However, once I realized what happened (through the help of a tutor), I literaly deleted that file and started over - being more careful this time not to accidently cut and past any blocks of code out of order.  Although frustrated in the beginning, in the end, I enjoyed testing out the model and ensured that it properly detects span vs non-spam text.
